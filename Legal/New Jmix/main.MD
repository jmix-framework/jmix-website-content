## Push the business forward

### 01 - Enable digital transformation

Jmix general purpose open architecture based on future proof technology stack is capable to support various digital initiatives across the organization.

### 02 - Improve business resilience

Jmix applications are indeed yours and can be supported independently thanks to open-source runtime utilizing mainstream technologies. Your data is secure with a server-side frontend development model and fine-grained access control.

### 03 - Simplify staffing

Any Java or Kotlin developer is a full-stack Jmix developer - you don’t need separate backend and frontend teams. Visual tools help onboarding developers who have little experience or move from an obsolete stack.

Jmix’s data centric approach and a single development language make it a natural fit to migrate legacy applications.

### 05 - Build with confidence

Jmix developers work with widely adopted open-source stack and convenient API instead of relying on proprietary black box frameworks.

### 06 - Cut license costs

Unlike most application development platforms, there are no fees for using the applications you’ve built.

### 07 - Get more projects done faster

Jmix supercharges your team with high productivity tools and ready to use components.

## Built for developers
